        "description": "Blue Bloods became a hit among many fans. Here are the Blue Bloods filming secrets everyone wants to know! Do the actors really eat the food during the iconic Sunday dinners? How did Donnie Wahlberg convince Bridget Moynahan to take the role of Erin Reagan? And why there real officers on the set?\n\nDonnie Wahlberg\u2019s on-screen niece Sami Gayle says that he\u2019s the best to work with. And he is the one who actually eats all the food at those famous Blue Bloods dinners! Bridget Moynahan and Will Estes prefer healthy food, while Tom Selleck only eats when cameras are rolling. \n\nLinda Reagan\u2019s demise was a shock for the fans \u2013 and for Amy Carlson as well! Another actress who controversially exited Blue Bloods was Jennifer Esposito. The newest addition to the Reagan family, Jamie Reagan\u2019s now-wife Eddie Janko first appeared on the show in its fourth season, but the actors had pretty good chemistry from the very start. But why Will Estes didn\u2019t want his and Vanessa Ray\u2019s characters to be a couple? Get to know the answer in this video! \n\n\nWelcome to OSSA Movies - a comfy place to explore the hidden world of your favorite movies and TV series. We are here to reveal the most unexpected behind the scenes secrets as well as fill in the gaps about all those hidden details you never notice during your first watching.\nHere you will always find simple and clear explanations to the most confusing endings and find out the craziest theories about the upcoming Netflix or HBO tv shows.\nIf you\u2019re looking for some decent entertainment content - you\u2019re in the right place!\nThanks for staying Ossa'm with us!",

        "description": "What Your Watch Says About You: Rolex, Omega, Cartier & More. There are so many videos about what your watch choices and tastes mean. If you like Rolex it means this and that about you. If you like OMEGA, it means this or that. And heaven forbid if you like Richard Mille or Hublot ;) \n\nI've seen so many videos on what your favourite watches means about you - but honestly - I think it is all a load of rubbish. I've watched sooo many videos on what it means if you like the Rolex Exlorer, or Submariner, or if you like the OMEGA Seamaster Diver 300. But the truth is: 1,000,000 different people have 1,000,000 different purchasing motivations. Some people love status and wealth, some people love the engineering, some people like to make informed, niche choices; while others might choose the same watch their dad wore. IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DEEP. \n\nSo these are my thoughts, and really just a rant on what your watch says about you. \n\nHOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME: \nInsta : watch.gringa\nEmail: watch.gringa@gmail.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/watch_gringa",

Photons to Photos (https://www.photonstophotos.net/ ) discovered that it\u2019s MORE THAN A FULL STOP behind cameras like the Nikon Z7 II, which is less expensive. A full stop is DOUBLE the dynamic range!\n\nMost likely, Nikon compromised dynamic range to improve the readout speed of the sensor. They might have reduced the well capacity of individual photosites to pack in some other type of circuitry to temporarily hold the charge from an exposure, similar to the way the Sony a9 III achieved a global shutter.\n\nTony Northrup takes real test shots to show you how much the difference is so you can decide whether it\u2019s good enough or if you\u2019d rather choose a camera with better dynamic range but worse autofocus and video performance. Everything is a compromise, but you deserve to make educated choices.",

        "description": "Support The Show On Patreon!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/seculartalk\n\nSubscribe to Krystal Kyle & Friends On Substack!:\nhttps://krystalkyleandfriends.substack.com\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/kylekulinski\n\n\"The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski\u2019s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers \u2014 loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.\n\n\u201cDo you like Kyle Kulinski?\u201d\n\nThe driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.\n\n\u201cHe understands what we\u2019re up against,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cLike Bernie.\u201d\n\nBut I was surprised to hear Kulinski\u2019s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski\u2019s show struck me as mostly capital-P \u201cprogressive\u201d takes on the news \u2014 the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.\n\nIt\u2019s an impression that wasn\u2019t entirely incorrect.\n\n\u201cI have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,\u201d Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about Lenin. I don\u2019t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.\u201d\n\nWith over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do \u2014 even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski\u2019s.\n\nWhile Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski\u2019s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he\u2019s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.\n\nBut unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks \u2014 who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago \u2014 the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on \u201cthe Millennial Left\u201d pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski\u2019s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of \u201cthe Squad\u201d to power.\n\nJust last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? \u201cThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,\u201d according to one moderator. In new media, he\u2019s king \u2014 the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he\u2019s nobody.\n\nI suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing \u201ccool\u201d about Kulinski\u2019s show. (As a friend put it, \u201c\u2018Welcome to Secular Talk\u2019 sounds like something you\u2019d hear on Egyptian radio.\u201d) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won\u2019t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as \u201cDirtbag Left.\u201d Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. \u201cNot only have I not attended one,\u201d he says, \u201cI have no idea what that means.\u201d\n\nAnd yet he\u2019s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan\u2019s wildly popular show, introduced them. \u201cYou make the most sense to me,\u201d Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. \u201cYou\u2019re a normal person.\u201d\n\nMuch like Sanders himself, Kulinski\u2019s show has a massive audience that just doesn\u2019t compute with our media\u2019s understanding of \u201cwhat the kids want\u201d or even \u201cwhat the left-wing kids want.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s probably for the best \u2014 the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. \u201cCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all \u2014 class issues,\u201d he said on a recent episode.\n\nRead More Here!:\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube\n\n#KyleKulinski #SecularTalk #news #politics #youtube #biden #economics #left #progressive #viral",

The strongest storm to hit parts of the Caribbean in decades brought punishing winds and storm surge to Jamaica a day earlier, passing the island as a Category 4, after killing at least seven people earlier in the week.\nThe Miami-based National Hurricane Center said that the Cayman Islands were being hit by strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves Thursday as Beryl was moving away from them.\nWith Beryl forecast to weaken over the next day or two, the storm was still at major hurricane strength when it passed Jamaica, the center said. Wind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed. Power was knocked out in much of the capital of Kingston.\n\n\n\n\nShipments of aid from South Florida are arriving in the Caribbean to help our neighbors recover from Hurricane Beryl.\nThere are now drop-off locations throughout the county to bring donations. Those include the Global Empowerment Mission (GEM) warehouse in Doral and several county libraries.\nThey have a specific list of needed goods including sheets, blankets, cots, sleeping bags, trash bags, tarps, tents, and nonperishable items. They do not need clothes.\nMiami-Dade Mayor Daniella Cava Levine stopped by the GEM warehouse, 1850 NW 84th Avenue, and said South Florida is ready to step up and help.\n\"They just need direction, what to do, so we have, of course, the main donation collection center at the GEM warehouse but you can also donate supplies at the following county libraries; South Dade, North Dade, and Aventura,\" she said. \nNorth Dade Regional Library, 2455 NW 183rd Street, Miami Gardens\nSouth Dade Regional Library, 10750 SW 211 Street, Cutler Bay\nAventura Library, 2930 NE 199th Street, Aventura\nDonations can also be dropped off at the Stephen P. Clark Center, 111 NW 1st Street in Miami.  \n\n\n\n\nCatch the Quickcast with Najahe Sherman weekdays at 4PM ET streaming on the CBS Miami app and CBSMiami.com\n\n#florida #miami #miamidade #localnews #local #community #politicalnews",

        "description": "The final votes in Britain's parliamentary elections are still being counted, but one thing is crystal clear: After 14 years in power, the Conservative Party is out.\n\nMore than that: It\u2019s been thoroughly punished by the British public, reduced to barely 120 seats, the party\u2019s worst result in it\u2019s history. Several prominent figures \u2014 including former Prime Minister Liz Truss \u2014 lost their seats.\n\nWhile other European countries are experiencing a rise in right-wing populism, Britain has rallied behind the centrist and sensible Labour Party and its centrist and sensible leader, Keir Starmer, who becomes prime minister.\n\nTo understand this huge trend-bucking shift, we once again turn to the fictional newscaster Jonathan Pie, performed by the comedian Tom Walker. In the Opinion video above, he offers his balanced, professional \u2014 and definitely not celebratory \u2014 take on the closing of this chapter in British political history.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world. It's all the news that's fit to watch.",

        "description": "You can build powerful arms, work your abs, and develop massive thigh muscles, but the lower pecs are a different story. Many guys find this area the hardest to fully develop, no matter how much they train. But if you know (and regularly do) the 9 exercises of this chest workout, you'll see the results pretty soon! And be sure to pay attention to the tips at the end of the video. They will make your lower chest workouts even more effective!\n\nOther videos you might like:\n19 Foods to Build Muscle and Gain Weight Faster https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM4iBO3_N-k&;\n\n10 At-Home Exercises to Get Rid of Belly Fat In a Month https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pitmJNYUz8&;\n\nWhat Will Happen If You Start Eating Oats Every Day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJLXIdvs40&\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\nDecline Bench Press 0:33\nDecline Dumbbell Fly 1:13\nChest Dips 2:06\nMachine Chest Press 2:58\nDumbbell Pull-Over 3:46\nCable Crossover 4:31\nSeated Machine Fly 5:32\nLower Pulley Cable Crossover 6:34\nPush-Ups 7:09\nSome useful tips 8:00\n\n#lowerchest #bigmuscles #brightside\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/\n\nSUMMARY:\n- #1. The decline bench press is the movement that targets precisely the lower part of your pectorals. As a result, your chest becomes wide, round, and defined. To make this exercise more effective, retract your shoulder blades and control the weight at all times.\n\n- #2. The decline dumbbell fly will help you get a good stretch as well as contraction. Besides developing your lower pecs, the decline dumbbell fly also trains your upper chest, biceps, and the front of your shoulders.\n\n- #3. The main trick while doing chest dips is to lean forward and put pressure on your chest rather than your triceps or shoulders. Also, your elbows should be a bit wider than your shoulders - this way, you'll exercise your chest better.\n\n- #4. The machine chest press not only targets your lower pecs, but also develops your biceps and deltoids. To make this exercise as effective as possible, retract your shoulder blades and try to tighten mostly your chest muscles.\n\n- #5. Even though dumbbell pull-overs work mostly your pecs, they're also pretty effective for training your triceps, abs, upper back muscles, and glutes. \n\n- #6. Cable crossover exercise doesn't involve any triceps activity, that's why it allows you to concentrate on your lower chest. Remember to squeeze your chest muscles when you're in the contracted position.  \n\n- #8. The seated machine fly is a great exercise for working both your inner and outer pecs, as well as your anterior delts. Remember to breathe normally while doing this exercise and don't press into your feet: after all, the purpose is to train your pecs, not your legs.\n\n- #9. While most people consider push-ups a warm-up exercise, it's actually quite effective for developing your chest muscles. The main trick to make this area work better is to position your hands wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\nStock materials (photos, footages and other):\nhttps://www.depositphotos.com\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com\nhttps://www.eastnews.ru\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/",

Tell us what you think in the comments below.\n\nRead more here: https://people.com/sandra-hemme-woman-conviction-murder-overturned-judge-believes-cop-did-it-8664950\n\n\"Sandra Hemme has spent more of her life behind bars than outside them. But a circuit court judge in Missouri now says the woman, who suffers from mental illness, should have never been incarcerated \u2013 and that a now-deceased local police officer was never properly investigated and should have likely instead been charged with the 1980 killing.\n\nJudge Ryan W. Horsman overturned Hemme\u2019s capital murder conviction in a Friday, June 14, order obtained by PEOPLE, calling the 64-year-old woman who has spent the last 43 years in prison \u201cthe victim of a manifest injustice.\u201d\"\n\n*** \n\nIndisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.\n\nHelp support our mission and get perks.

        "description": "At the dawn of the Gulf War in early 1991, the skies over the Middle East became a dangerous gauntlet. Among the large forces sent by the Royal Air Force to liberate Kuwait were only 12 models of a supersonic jet attack aircraft: the aging SEPECAT Jaguar.\n\nDismissed as obsolete, it was unexpectedly thrust into this hostile environment. Tasked with roles from ground attack and close air support to battlefield air interdiction, the Jaguars faced relentless challenges to disrupt enemy operations and protect coalition forces.\n\nAttacks against SAM sites were routine, pushing the pilots\u2019 luck every single time. These missions were sheer madness by Cold War standards, as the Jaguars dove right into the heart of the enemy\u2019s missile engagement zone at medium altitude, fully exposed to surface-to-air defenses.\n\nThere was no chance to climb above the missile's reach, no room for error.\n\nAgainst all odds, camouflaged in desert hues and armed to the teeth, the 'Desert Cats' took to the stormy skies time and time again without losing a single aircraft.\n\n---\n\nJoin Dark Skies as we explore the world of aviation with cinematic short documentaries featuring the biggest and fastest airplanes ever built, top-secret military projects, and classified missions with hidden untold true stories. Including US, German, and Soviet warplanes, along with aircraft developments that took place during World War I, World War 2, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and special operations mission in between. \n\nAs images and footage of actual events are not always available, Dark Skies sometimes utilizes similar historical images and footage for dramatic effect and soundtracks for emotional impact. We do our best to keep it as visually accurate as possible.\n\nAll content on Dark Skies is researched, produced, and presented in historical context for educational purposes. We are history enthusiasts and are not always experts in some areas, so please don't hesitate to reach out to us with corrections, additional information, or new ideas.",
